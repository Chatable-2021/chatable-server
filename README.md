# chatable-server

## Goal 

#### The goal of chatabal-server is to build a dope back end.
#### By _**David Butler**_ _**Ethan Pierce**_ _**Justin Martin**_

## Description
#### For the back end we are using socket.io and postgresql to build the server and save data. Sockets have traditionally been the solution around which most real-time chat systems are architected, providing a bi-directional communication channel between a client and a server. This means that the server can push messages to clients. Whenever you write a chat message, the idea is that the server will get it and push it to all other connected clients.
